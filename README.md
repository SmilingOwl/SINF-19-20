**Curricular Unity:** SINF - Information systems

**Lective Year:** 2019/2020

Developed in collaboration with *Helena Montenegro* and *João Lima*.

## Overview

The theme of this project is 360º Company Dashboard.
The project’s objective is to develop a web app which provides relevant information about the company status.
The project will take a SAF-T file as input and show information about sales and the company’s financial situation. It’ll also have information about the company’s purchases, which will be accessed through Jasmin’s API. There will also be shown information relative to
each product, so that the user can analyse how it has been doing in terms of sales, and to each supplier.
The use of comprehensive visualizations in the web app aims to simplify the analysis of the large amount of data inherent to the business, thus easing the decision making process.

## Technologies used
* **React** and **Bootstrap** – front-end development.
* **Express (NodeJS)** – back-end development which includes parsing a SAF-T and making calls to Jasmin’s API.
